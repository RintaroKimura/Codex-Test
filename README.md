# Codex-Test

This repository contains a simple command-line Hangman game written in Python. The word list now features Judy Garland's feature films, so you can guess the titles of her movies.

Spaces, punctuation, and digits in the titles are revealed automatically during play.

## How to run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed and run the script:

```bash
python3 hangman.py
```

Follow the prompts to guess the word. Have fun!
